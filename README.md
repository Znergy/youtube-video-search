# Youtube Video Search

## Description
This project was created using React, Youtube Search API, and Bootstrap. The code was written following along with a Udemy course called 'Modern React with Redux'. This is the first project in the course, which covers 80% of React. The rest of the course focuses on Redux and all the fun that comes along with Redux.

## Udemy Course
[Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/), by Stephen Grider.

## Review
Stephen Grider is a great teacher and I've learned a ton from this course already. Stephen takes the approach of showing errors that arise and then how to go about solving them, which really sticks with you. Stephen has produced a series of React courses, 'Modern React and Redux' is more of the introduction. Then there is 'Node with React: Full Stack Web Development' and 'Advanced React with Redux'. I plan on taking all three of them.
